Bringing Augmented Reality to Travel Applications

I recently completed an AR-based UI design project using Uizard.io, focused on enriching user experiences in the travel domain. This concept allows users to point their mobile camera at a monument and instantly access historical details, factual information, and interactive content in real time.

Project Highlights:

AR-enabled monument recognition

Real-time interactive historical insights

Clean, minimalist, and user-friendly UI

Tools & Technologies:

Designed using Uizard.io

This project represents a step forward in integrating Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, and UX Design to create smarter, more immersive travel experiences.

I look forward to connecting with professionals interested in the intersection of emerging tech and user-centered design.
